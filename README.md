## ðŸ›  Technologies

## ðŸ“£ Overview

In 2022, content creators need to provide their audience with content as efficiently as possible. This means building a content management flow that takes publishing content to the world easy, and it means building a platform visible to search engines that will serve that content to users as quickly as possible. By porting an outdated Wordpress blog over to a Next.js, pages rendered on the server side are sent and displayed by the users device in less than a second. Utilizing Contentful, a flexible content management system, code maintenance is taken out of the artists hands to that they can focus on what they do best, publishing beautiful art.
